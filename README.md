# MLFromScratch

MTG drafter using Keras and Pandas, data for the draft picking comes from 17Lands 

v0: Made a simple LLM that can make a 45 card deck based on a given MTG set 

v1: Upgraded the learning model by tweaking the value of our optimizer Adam, the size of the LSTM layer and the epochs 

v1.5: Added the rules of drafting in MTG, the model now can act as an user in a drafting environment
